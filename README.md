## About me 

I have been working in web development since 2011. I co-founded a startup, served as CTO
at a Fintech, and contributed to diverse projects across Brazil and the United States. I focus
on collaborative work, delivering results, and leveraging data metrics to maximize user value.
I hold three AWS certifications (AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner, AWS Certified Solutions
Architect Associate, and AWS Certified AI Practitioner). I am passionate about technology,
system design, high availability, scalability, and performance, and I continually explore
emerging trends and innovations, with a current focus on system design and GenAI.
